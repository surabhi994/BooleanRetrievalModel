# BooleanRetrievalModel
 An inverted index has been built using the information extracted from the data. Two strategies- Document at a time and Term at a time- have been used to return Boolean query results. 
 
 
 Five methods have been implemented namely-
</br>1.GetPostings- It retrieves the posting list for each of the given query term
</br>2.TaatAND - This method is to used to implement multi-term boolean AND query on the index using term-at-a-time
</br>3.TaatOR -This function implements multi-term boolean OR query on the index using TAAT strategy
</br>4.DaatAnd- This method implements multi-term boolean AND query on the index using Document-at-a-time strategy
</br>5.DaatOr-This method implemets multi-term boolean OR query on the index using Document-at-a-time strategy
